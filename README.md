# Web applications

## Learning goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
  * **Write integration tests for a web application** using a test framework to call HTTP endpoints and assert on the received response and/or application's behaviour.
  * **Implement web HTTP endpoints**, using a lightweight web framework, to interface with the backend database which the application connects to.
  * **Follow a debugging process for a web applications** and use a high-level knowledge of the HTTP protocol and the request / response cycle to get visibility into the flow of a web request, from a client (browser or other tool) to the application server, and into the different layers of the application itself.
  * **Deploy the web application** using a straightforward cloud/PaaS service, such as Heroku.

## Phase One: HTTP Bites

Go through these exercises and learn about the HTTP protocol and the Request and Response flow between a client and a server.

1. [Introduction to HTTP.](./http_bites/01_intro_to_http.ed.md)
2. [Requests and Responses](./http_bites/02_requests_and_responses.ed.md)
3. [Sending request with parameters](./http_bites/03_request_parameters.ed.md)

## Phase Two

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup and gradually build a program which exposes a database through HTTP endpoints.

1. [Setting up a Sinatra project](./challenges/01_setting_up_sinatra_project.ed.md)
2. [Building routes](./challenges/02_building_a_route.ed.md)
3. [Test-driving routes](./challenges/03_test_driving_a_route.ed.md)
4. [Using JSON to return structured content](./challenges/04_sending_json_response.ed.md)
5. [Test-driving routes to interface with a database](./challenges/05_test_driving_route_with_database.ed.md)
6. [Deploying your web server](./challenges/06_deploying.ed.md)

## Phase Three: HTML & ERB Bites

7. Using HTML to return browser-friendly content.
7. Using ERB to generate dynamic HTML.
8. Using links to send `GET` requests.
9. Using the browser's developer console
10. Using forms to send `POST` requests.

## Phase Four: Solo challenge
