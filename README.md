# Web applications

## Learning goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
  * **Write integration tests for a web application** using a test framework to call HTTP endpoints and assert on the received response and/or application's behaviour.
  * **Implement web HTTP endpoints**, using a lightweight web framework, to interface with the backend database which the application connects to.
  * **Follow a debugging process for a web applications** and use a high-level knowledge of the HTTP protocol and the request / response cycle to get visibility into the flow of a web request, from a client (browser or other tool) to the application server, and into the different layers of the application itself.
  * **Deploy the web application** using a straightforward cloud/PaaS service, such as Heroku.

## Phase One: HTTP Bites

Go through these exercises and learn about the HTTP protocol and the Request and Response flow between a client and a server.

1. [Introduction to HTTP.](./http_bites/01_intro_to_http.md)
2. [Requests and Responses](./http_bites/02_requests_and_responses.md)
3. [Sending request with parameters](./http_bites/03_request_parameters.md)

## Phase Two

Go through these exercises and learn how to setup and gradually build a program which exposes a database through HTTP endpoints.

Some of these challenges include [Process Feedback Challenges](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md), in which you record yourself performing the task and share it with your coach for feedback. These are tagged with a 📡.
