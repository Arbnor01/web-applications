# Chitter

In this project, you'll build a database-backed web application on which a user can post messages (peeps) and read them, using a web browser.

Do these user stories first:

```
As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was posted

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to create a user account

As a Maker
So my account can be secured
I want to have my username and password stored in my user account
```

Then, these harder ones:

```
As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter with my username and password

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter
```

And finally this advanced one:

```
As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```
