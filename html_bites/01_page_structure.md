Learn to return HTML responses to be viewed in a web browser.

## Intro

Web browsers are clients.

When a web browser sends a request and receives a response, it is displayed to the user.

If that response contains HTML code, that code is interpreted and transformed into a graphical, user-friendly web page.

Whenever you visit a website using your web browser, the following happens behind the scenes:
  * the web browser sends a `GET` request to the server.
  * the web browser receives the response.
  * the web browser interprets the HTML code to know what to display.
  * the web browser shows a graphical web page (with text, images, buttons, etc) to the user.

It's important to note that this process happens **again for every new page**.

If we reload the page, the same process happens. If we visit a different page, the same process happens.

Every time we visit a URL, the web browser acts as a client — it sends a `GET` request to this URL and path, gets the response, and interprets the HTML as a user-friendly web page. It is really important that you keep this in mind when building, using and debugging your web applications, to have a good idea of what is happening.

## Demonstration

@TODO

## Exercise One

Change the `GET /hello` route from the previous project so it returns the following HTML:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
